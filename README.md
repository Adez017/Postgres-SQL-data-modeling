# PostgreSQL Data Modeling Project


## Introduction
This project demonstrates data modeling concepts and techniques using **PostgreSQL**. It covers the creation of relational database schemas, normalization of data, and establishing relationships between tables. The project is designed to help users understand and implement efficient data storage and retrieval practices.

## Features
- Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram representation of the data model.
- Normalized relational database schema.
- Implementation of **Primary Keys**, **Foreign Keys**, and **Indexes**.
- Optimized schema for scalability and performance.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system.
- **SQL**: Query language for data definition and manipulation.
- **PgAdmin**: PostgreSQL database management.
- Tools for ER Diagram (draw.io).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL installed on your machine. [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Basic knowledge of SQL.

Now youâ€™re all set to dive into the PostgreSQL data modeling project! Follow the setup steps and explore the power of efficient database design with relational models.
